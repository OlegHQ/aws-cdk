 * @deprecated Use `OpenIdConnectProviderNative` instead. To migrate existing resources without removing the OIDC provider endpoint, follow these steps:
 * 1. Set the removalPolicy of the existing `OpenIdConnectProvider` to `RemovalPolicy.RETAIN`.
 * 2. Deploy with the retain policy to avoid deletion of the underlying resource.
 * 3. Remove the `OpenIdConnectProvider` defintion from the stack and run `cdk diff`. You should see the provider resources marked for orphaning.
 * 4. Deploy the stack again to orphan the resource in CloudFormation. `cdk deploy`
 * 5. Replace `OpenIdConnectProvider` with `OpenIdConnectProviderNative` in your code
 * 6. Run `cdk import` to import the existing OIDC provider resource by providing the existing ARN.
 * 7. (Optional): You may now delete the custom resource lambda function that was created as part of the deprecated `OpenIdConnectProvider` construct and its associated resources such as IAM roles.
 * See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/ref-cli-cmd-import.html
